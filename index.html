          <p>As a student studying the bachelor of information technology at RMIT University, I have always been interested in cyber security. Cyber security is the protection of inter-connected systems, including hardware,software and data from cyberattacks. One topic of cyber security that deeply interests me is white hat hacking, it refers to an ethical computer hacker or even a computer security specialist which specialises in penetration testing and prevention of loopholes in order to ensure the security of an organisations information systems.</p>

          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></h5>
          <p>I chose to do my Bachelor of Information Technology because of RMIT’s great reputation in the IT industry, and I felt like this was a great opportunity to broaden and hasten my skills for the future. My experience so far throughout the course, is that it has a very hands-on approach to the course and that it allows us to implement code that we’ve learnt. Throughout this course, I expect gain mainstream industry skills that I can implement once I choose specialising in Cyber security.</p>

          <p>In order to obtain these qualifications, everybody needs a starting point. I think a strong starting point for me, is to probably obtain an internship at a company that specialises in cyber security. By doing this I would not only be able to obtain knowledge in the field but also experience a hands-on experience. It would also be very rewarding if I could learn IPS skills and have an insight on how to handle threats and prevent them. </p><br>

                                <p>Atleast 8 in 10 people use a wide variey of social media platforms every day, however, messages are not sercured when it is passed through networks. Intruders can the users messages easily. Therefore, my project idea consists of using various algorithms to encrypt these texts.</p>

                                <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Motivation</b></h5>
                                <p>In 2016 more than 1 million andriod phone users around the world had their devices hacked in a global security breach; Gooligan. Using encryption when sending messages makes it harder for hackers to access these messages. By doing this, hackers would not be able to gain anything from these messages as only the creater of the encrytion code can decrypt it, there will strengthen security on all social media platforms. </p><br>

                              <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Description</b></h5>
                              <p>The system proposes a system where the user will enter plain text and select the algorithm type that is used eg. AES,DES, MD5... and provide they key, a chipper text will be formed that can be send via any communication application and the end user can decrypt the text by selecting the same algorithm type and must ender the same sender secret key. It will be difficult for the intruder to decrypt the message. By using this method you can double ensure that your messages is sent sercurely without outside interference of hackers or crackers.</p><br>

                            <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Tools and skills required</b></h5>
                            <p>The number one neccessity for this program is that it requires an active internet connection, without this the code cannot be encryted as the messages need to be sent via connection. Also, obviously when making the program either experience in Java or C++ is required. You also need to have experience regarding encrytion and decrytion of websites. In terms of obtaining these necessities, it is rather simple, you only need a computer and an active internet connection. However regarding the skills, you would need experience.  </p><br>

                          <p>If the project is successful, it will impact millions of users that use social media. Not only this but this method will prevent hackers and crackers from trying to take advantage of unencrypted messages. In the future, this may have an impact on the internet as they will personally make their own unique encrytion systems bruteforcing security on the internet.   </p><br>
